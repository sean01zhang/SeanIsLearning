;; ~ SETTING: black.jpg

;; STORY: Hitomi (n): In the darkness, filled with starlight, I am flying
away. The cold air stirs up my hair. Where is this place? I was
supposed to be on the roof of the school. Then from the river of
stars, came a vast blue light. Floating above us in the sky, is a big
blue star. Earth? Yes... that's the Earth floating in the sky. Why?
The white-winged man, with black hair swaying, his name is... Van. Me,
being carried in Van's arms, dropping from the sky towards the Earth.

;; SETTING: anime-background.jpeg

;; STORY: Van: Goddess of Wings, that blue star is my world, Gaea. Your
homeland.

;; STORY: Hitomi: Mine?

;; ~ STORY: Folken: Deliver the Goddess of Wings to me.

;; STORY: Van: Folken!

;; STORY: Hitomi: Van!

;; STORY: Hitomi (n): Van's wings become engulfed in blue flame and burst into
fire.

;; STORY: Van: I will not part with the Goddess of Wings!

;; STORY: Hitomi (n): Our descent speed increases steadily. My consciousness
fades away. Next to me, the warmth of his body is the only thing I
feel. The flowing starlight, filling all of space, extends above. The
two of us are engulfed into the light.

;; STORY: Merle: Mole Man! The sky... beyond the king a blue light is coming
into view!

;; STORY: Mole Man: Oooh! So it is just as Orm said. That's Allen's Mystic
Moon. How beautiful! A perfectly round blue jewel...

;; STORY: Merle: He's coming! He's coming, Mole Man! Van's coming back!

;; STORY: Mole Man: Ho ho, is this just as in the old wives' tales?

;; STORY: Merle: Let's go!

;; STORY: Mole Man: Uh... don't panic... Wait!

;; STORY: Hitomi (n): The light disappears, and I am once again enveloped in
darkness. But, next to me, I can sense Van's presence. The weeds
spread beneath our feet, and the smell of decomposing wood in the soft
earth diffuses around us. Above in the sky that I thought was dark,
the overflowing radiance spills down towards us, the starlight rising
to the surface throughout the entire sky.

;; STORY: Hitomi: Stars in the sky? The night sky is... Where? Where are we?

;; STORY: Van: The planet of your birthplace. In order to meet with you, you
have been brought to this land. To the place called the village of
Adom.

;; STORY: Hitomi (n): Van slowly draws away from me, and kneels.

;; STORY: Van: Goddess of Wings, I am the king of the dragon tribe, Van. In
order to bring justice to this Gaea, please deliver the dragon armor
to me.

;; STORY: Hitomi: Hold on a second, I...

;; STORY: Hitomi (n): My breath has stopped. Behind Van, a gigantic blue
moon... Earth? That's it, surely it's the Earth that I see. And below
it is the Moon? It's about as big as the Moon from my world... but,
the patterns on its surface are a little bit different. The king
before me, Van, turns around and looks up at the Earth.

;; STORY: Van: With the Mystic Moon having appeared, what better proof could
there possibly be that you are in fact the Goddess of Wings?

;; STORY: Hitomi: The Mystic Moon? The earth? Then, where is here?

;; STORY: Van: A moon forged of steel, a world of fire and water, Gaea.

;; STORY: Hitomi: Gaea?

;; STORY: Van: A long time ago, when you were still incarnate upon this land,
men and beast men were even then in a state of torment. But now,
conflict between the human tribes has brought this world to ruin.
Please give me the dragon armor, Escaflowne, so that I can end this
conflict.

;; STORY: Hitomi: Escaflowne?

;; STORY: Hitomi (m): Escaflowne? What a strange sound. This strange world, is
this my birthplace? My head is in turmoil. This kind of stuff, who
would believe it? But, this world is beautiful. Spreading high in the
sky, a countless sea of stars... such a beautiful night sky, it's the
first time I've ever seen it. Pretty. Stretching out my hand, I can
almost touch the light from the stars. Below the starry sky,
underneath the blue Earth, kneeling, looking up to me is Van. His
transparent eyes, staring at me as if they can see right through
me. With bright black hair, and shining silver armor on one
side. Leather hide wrapped around his hip. Bearing a sword with a
Japanese blade. With the aura of an emperor, he looks at me. Van,
that's his name.
